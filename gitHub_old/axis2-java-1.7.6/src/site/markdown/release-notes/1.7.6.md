Apache Axis2 1.7.6 Release Note
-------------------------------

Apache Axis2 1.7.6 is a maintenance release containing the following fixes and
improvements:

*   The JSTL is now packaged into the Axis2 Web application. This fixes issues
    with the Admin consoles on servlet containers that don't provide the JSTL.
*   The `commons-fileupload` dependency has been updated to a version that fixes
    CVE-2016-1000031 ([AXIS2-5853][]).
*   A fix for [AXIS2-5863][], a possible null pointer dereference in generated
    code flagged by static code analyzers.
*   The dependencies of the Maven plugins have been updated to prevent issues
    with temporary files being written to the source tree. This is part of the
    fix for [AXIS2-5781][].
*   The source code is now buildable with Java 8.
