Apache Tomcat Maven Plugin

  This is the new home for the Tomcat Maven Plugin (previously hosted at Codehaus).

  The version ${project.version} have the following new features:

  * Apache Tomcat7 support

  * {{{./executable-war-jar.html}Build an Executable War/Jar}}

  []

  More details in {{{./jira-report.html}Generated changelog from issue tracker}}.

  The Tomcat Maven Plugin provides goals to manipulate WAR projects within the {{{http://tomcat.apache.org/}Apache Tomcat}} servlet container.

  Or to run your war project in an embeded Apache Tomcat. The run goal give you the opportunity to develop quickly your application without any
  huge install to do manually. More details and features: {{{./run-mojo-features.html}see documentation}}.

* groupId and Mojo name change

  Since version 2.0-beta-1 tomcat mojos has been renamed to tomcat6 and tomcat7 with the same goals.

  You must configure your pom to use this new groupId:

+----------
    <pluginManagement>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.apache.tomcat.maven</groupId>
          <artifactId>tomcat6-maven-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>${project.version}</version>
        </plugin>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.apache.tomcat.maven</groupId>
          <artifactId>tomcat7-maven-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>${project.version}</version>
        </plugin>
      </plugins>
    </pluginManagement>
+----------

  Or add the groupId in your settings.xml

+----------
  <pluginGroups>
    ....
    <pluginGroup>org.apache.tomcat.maven</pluginGroup>
    ....
  </pluginGroups>
+----------


* Goals Overview


  * {{{./context-goals.html}Goals to manipulate deployed projects within Tomcat}}

  * {{{./container-goals.html}Goals to obtain information from Tomcat}}

  * {{{./executable-war-jar.html}Build an Executable War/Jar}}

  []

* Know limitations

  Some goals are not yet available in tomcat7 mojo. Those {{{./container-goals.html}container goals}} are available with
  the tomcat6 mojo, you only need to update the manager url in your pom.

  Use <<<http://localhost:8080/manager/html>>> rather than the default tomcat6 url.
