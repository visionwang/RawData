CLue - Command Line tool for Apache Lucene
==========================================

### Overview:

When working with Lucene, it is often useful to inspect an index.

[Luke](http://www.getopt.org/luke/) is awesome, but often times it is not feasible to inspect an index on a remote machine using a GUI. That's where Clue comes in.
You can ssh into your production box and inspect your index using your favorite shell.

Another important feature for Clue is the ability to interact with other Unix commands via piping, e.g. grep, more etc.

### Build:

mvn package

This will create 2 artifacts in the target directory:

1. clue-xxx.jar

   jar file containing all clue classes.

2. clue-all-xxx.jar

   executable jar file containing all clue classes as well as all runtime dependencies, e.g. java -jar clue-all-xxx.jar works

### Run:

Interactive Mode:

    ./bin/clue.sh my-idx

Non-interactive Mode:

    ./bin/clue.sh my-idx command args

Command list:

    ./bin/clue.sh my-idx help

### Build a sample index to play with:

Clue bundles with some test data (15000 car data) for you to build a sample index to play with, do:

    ./bin/build_sample_index.sh my-idx
	

### Examples:

1. Getting all the terms in the field 'color_indexed':

    **./bin/clue.sh my-idx terms color_indexed**

2. Getting all the terms in the field 'color_indexed' starting with the term staring with 'r':

    **./bin/clue.sh my-idx terms color_indexed:r**

    **./bin/clue.sh my-idx terms color_indexed | grep r**

3. Do a search:

    **./bin/clue.sh my-idx search myquery**

4. Get the index info:

    **./bin/clue.sh my-idx info**

5. Iterate a posting for the term color_indexed:red

    **./bin/clue.sh my-idx postings color_indexed:red**

6. List docvalues for the column-stride-field color:

    **./bin/clue.sh my-idx docval color**

7. Get docvalue for the column-stride-field *category* for document 4:

    **./bin/clue.sh my-idx docval *category* 5**

8. Get docvalue for the column-stride-field *year* of type numeric for document 3:

	**./bin/clue.sh my-idx docval year 3**
	
9. Get docvalue for the column-stride-field *json* of type binary for document 3:

	**./bin/clue.sh my-idx docval json 3**
	
9. Get docvalue for the column-stride-field *tags* of type sorted-set for document 3:

	**./bin/clue.sh my-idx docval tags 3**
