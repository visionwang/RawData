to build this project you must Apache Maven at least 2.2.1 .
mvn clean install will install the mojos without running integration tests.
As there are some hardcoded integration tests with http port 1973, ajp 2001 and 2008, you could have some port allocation issues (if you don't know why those values ask olamy :-) )
mvn clean install -Prun-its will run integration tests too: to override the default used htpp port you can use -Dits.http.port= -Dits.ajp.port=
To deploy a snaphot version to https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/, you must run : mvn clean deploy .
Note you need some configuration in ~/.m2/settings.xml:
    <server>
      <id>apache.snapshots</id>
      <username>your asf id</username>
      <!--password></password-->
      <!--privateKey>path to your private key</privateKey-->
      <!--passphrase></passphrase-->
      <filePermissions>664</filePermissions>
      <directoryPermissions>775</directoryPermissions>
    </server

NOTE: a Jenkins job deploy SNAPSHOT automatically https://builds.apache.org/job/TomcatMavenPlugin-mvn3.x/.
So no real to deploy manually, just commit and Jenkins will do the job for you.

If you have a nice ssh key in ~/.ssh/ no need of configuring password, privateKey, passphrase.

Checkstyle: this project use the Apache Maven checkstyle configuration for ide codestyle files see http://maven.apache.org/developers/committer-environment.html .

Site: to test site generation, just run: mvn site. If you want more reporting (javadoc, pmd, checkstyle, jxr, changelog from jira entries), use: mvn site -Preporting.

To deploy site, use: mvn clean site-deploy -Preporting. The site will be deploy to http://tomcat.apache.org/maven-plugin-${project.version}

For release your ~/.m2/settings.xml must contains :

    <server>
      <id>apache.releases.https</id>
      <username>asf id</username>
      <password>asf password</password>
    </server>
