r914998: fixing providers discovering errors. Now we just need to fix the failing tests
r782732: Don't use the discovery mechanism for cache impls. for now, this means the AbderaClient is hard coded to use the LRUCache in-memory cache implementation. The original design meant for the cache implementation to be pluggable. Ideally, however, the HttpClient would incorporate some kind of cache so we wouldn't have to do this at all. I'm wondering if there's some way we could separate all the http client related stuff out to a distinct subproject?

r772439: Fix NPE waiting to happen
r772417: Refactoring of some of the base level class discovery code. The moves things to a more logical location, improves the reliability of the implementation and simplifies the code structure a bit.

r772316: Fixing the ant build
r771562: Ignore eclipse artifacts
r771487: Fix for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ABDERA-222 The PeekAheadInputStream was writing too much back to the buffer, which introduces 0x0 chars to the stream
r771450: For https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ABDERA-210

   ResponseContext needs to be able to support non-Atom binary resources so we cannot assume that 
   AbderaServlet should always use a Writer. This adds a new method to ResponseContext called isBinary,
   which defaults to false.  If true, the AbderaServlet will pass the OutputStream to ResponseContext,
   if false, the servlet will pass the Writer to ResponseContext. 

   This also fixes a bug in ResponseContextWrapper.
r771446: One fix for two issues: ABDERA-213, ABDERA-211: No way to explicitly declare namespaces using StreamWriter interface
         StreamWriter interface not outputting correct namespace for atom:link element in service docs
