bad.factory.init.verify=cannot initialize signature verification factory without trusted ring
bad.factory.init.verify.empty=trusted ring read in is null, cannot proceed
bad.factory.init.generate=cannot initialize signature generation factory without secret key

no.stream.processor=neither signature generator nor signature verifier has been initialized. Don't know what to do.
no.trusted.ring=trusted ring seem to be empty. There is no one I can trust, so signature verification is pointless.
