        <section name="OpenWebbeans">
            <subsection name="Introduction">
                As of Version 1.0.4 Ext-Scripting has introduced basic openwebbeans support.
                This support is considered to be experimental so use it with care.
                <p/>
                This means you can define CDI Beans within the supported scripting languages
                and you can provide dynamic reloading (in a more simplified manner)
                to OWB.
                <p/>
                The reloading is different to standard JSF due to CDI limitations, in case
                of a changed bean the entire container is reloaded instead of the bean
                and its dependencies. This has to be taken into consideration if you use
                the OWB support module.
                <p/>
                Also Ext-Scripting OWB is an extension module, it is not part of the core distribution you get
                if you include the<b>extscript-myfaces20-bundle</b>.
                So a separate include of the OWB support
                <b>module extscript-cdi</b>
                is needed.
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Setup">
                To setup the OWB support module, you have to drop the extscript-cdi.jar into your
                WEB-INF/lib or you have to add following code into maven.
                <source><![CDATA[
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.myfaces.extensions.scripting</groupId>
    <artifactId>extscript-cdi</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.5</version>
</dependency>
                ]]></source>
                And of course OpenWebbeans must be properly present, either via the app server
                or simply by a Maven include.
                No further setup needs to be done for the OWB integration, all other configuration
                entries stay the same.
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Example Project">
                An Example Kickstarter project has been provided which shows the capabilities of the
                plugin.
                You can use it as kickstarter for your own OWB based Ext-Scripting projects.
                It can be found under
                <b>extscript-examples/cdi-example</b>
                from the root
                dir of the project.
                You can start it with mvn
                <b>jetty:run-exploded</b>
                and you can edit the files in the
                <b>target/&lt;webappname;gt;/WEB-INF...</b>
                folder on the fly.
            </subsection>

        <section name="Spring">
            <subsection name="Introduction">
                As of version 1.0.5 basic spring support has been provided to Ext-Scripting.
                This support is considered to be experimental so use it with care.
                <p/>
                Spring support means you can define Spring Beans within the supported scripting languages
                and you can provide dynamic reloading to Spring.
                <p/>
                Also Spring support is an extension module, it is not part of the core distribution you get
                if you include the<b>extscript-myfaces20-bundle</b>.
                So a separate include of the Spring support
                <b>module extscript-spring</b>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="setup">
                To setup the Spring support you have to add following dependencies:
                <br/>
                Either the extscript-spring.jar to your project additionally to the
                Ext-Script bundle jar.
                <br></br>
                Or add following to your Maven configuration file:
                <source><![CDATA[
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.myfaces.extensions.scripting</groupId>
    <artifactId>extscript-spring</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.5</version>
</dependency>
                ]]></source>

                And of course Spring must be properly present, either via the app server
                or simply by a Maven include.
                <p/>
                Also following parameter must be added to your web.xml:
                <source><![CDATA[
<listener>
    <!-- this listener class enables our spring reloading -->
    <listener-class>
        org.apache.myfaces.extensions.scripting.spring.context.CompilationAwareContextLoaderListener
    </listener-class>
</listener>
                ]]></source>
